### Data Source

The company provides different data sets: sales_pipeline.csv, products.csv, accounts.csv, sales_team.csv, data_dictionary.csv

### Tools

- Power BI - Data cleaning, Visualization, and for creating a report

### Importation and Data Cleaning

Imported the given data into Power BI one after the other then,

1. I proceed to data cleaning by removing empty rows from each of the table column
2. Still in the transform page I worked on the sales_team table by converting its first row to a Header and I also rename the account table to the company because a column is already named accounts so in other to avoid 
   confusion later when working.

### Problem Statements

1. Explore the sales pipeline data to identify bottlenecks and inefficiencies in converting leads to sales. 

(i).  Analyze which stages in the pipeline have the highest drop-off rates 

(ii). Suggest strategies for improvement.


2. Leverage account data and historical sales figures to develop a model that predicts which accounts have the highest potential for future sales growth. This can help prioritize sales efforts for maximum return.

3. Analyze product data and sales figures to identify which products are most profitable considering revenue

4. Analyzing sales performance by territory and account data determines if the current sales territory allocation is optimal.

5. Which sales agent has the product with the most sales or the sales agent with the most sales

Q2:  The account with the highest revenue is "Kan-code" with a total revenue of $11,698.03 in 187days i.e from my calculation they make $62.56 daily, with facts showing that they tend to have future sales growth but rather my prediction is that Xx-holdings account has the highest potential future sales growth because they make $7,537.24 revenue in just 79 days i.e, they are making $95.4 daily.
